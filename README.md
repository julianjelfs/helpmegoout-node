# Help Me Go Out - node edition

This is a version of my [Help Me Go Out](http://www.helpmegoout.co.uk) site written using a 
different technology stack. this time instead of rails I am going for Zurb Foundation + Angular + Node + Express + MongoDB

The purpose of Help Me Go Out is to allow a community of friends to organise to baby sit for one another easily.
